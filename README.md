# 📄 Resume/CV Ranker using BERT (NLP Project)

This project uses **Transformer models (BERT / DistilBERT)** to **rank resumes based on how well they match a given job description (JD)**. It’s a real-world application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in the HR domain — helping recruiters quickly identify the best candidates.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Fine-tuned transformer-based model to **embed job descriptions and resumes**
- ✅ Calculates **semantic similarity** between resumes and the JD
- ✅ Outputs a **ranked list** of candidates based on fit
- ✅ Beginner-friendly code in **Jupyter Notebook**
- ✅ Bonus: Streamlit web app to upload JDs and resumes (coming soon)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)
- `transformers` and `sentence-transformers` (for BERT embeddings)
- `scikit-learn` (for similarity computation)
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- Optional: `streamlit` (for dashboard UI)

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Input**: One job description and multiple resumes.
2. **Embedding**: Texts are embedded using `SentenceTransformer` (based on BERT).
3. **Similarity**: Cosine similarity compares resumes to the job description.
4. **Ranking**: Resumes are ranked from most to least relevant.

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-ranker.git
   cd resume-ranker
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook ResumeRanker.ipynb

✅ Example Output
Resume Text	Similarity Score
Resume A: "Data scientist with NLP experience..."	0.89
Resume B: "React developer with frontend skills"	0.55
Resume C: "HR coordinator with 5 years experience"	0.31

💡 Future Enhancements
Upload resumes in PDF/DOCX formats

Build a fully interactive Streamlit dashboard

Support for multiple job descriptions

Add custom fine-tuning for industry-specific roles
